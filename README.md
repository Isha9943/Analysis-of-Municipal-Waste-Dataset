# Analysis-of-Municipal-Waste-Dataset

This research paper presents a study on the use of linear regression models to predict the
relationship between the dependent variable (cost per capita) and the independent variables
(other columns) of the Municipal Waste management dataset from Kaggle.1 The objective
of the research was to analyze the dataset and make prediction model and optimize it. This
paper also includes the discussion of the various data pre-processing techniques like data
cleaning, outlier analysis, log transformation, standardization and feature selection. The
prediction models used are Linear Regression Model, Random Forest Regression Mode
and the Histogram Gradient Boosting Regression Model, which have been discussed in the
detail to make it easy to understand. The metrics use to check the prediction quality of
these models are R2- score, MSE and RMSE. This study demonstrates the value of linear
regression models in predictive modeling and provides insights into the best practices for
using these models in real-world scenarios.
